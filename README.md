#Purpose of this Repository
Create a react application improving on elements originally done in ReadyBank (Previous University project) that had components such as layout, login & Registration that were not done to a high quality standard. It's important to note that the homepage was originally created in July (evident with Last Updated: 19/6/22) which was right after the the Professional Development project had ended. Sections of the project had either changed over time or simply had been finished and started looking at different things to include. (Login & Register)

#Navbar
The Navbar is responsive even when selecting the bootstrap icon, I find that even clicking the icon should lead to the original page that the website is intended to load upon. 

Having the far left side of the navigation bar return to the homepage while the right side allowed navigation through the website creates a sense of balance that allows the user to navigate and create awareness to the whole page.

#Homepage
This homepage is to demonstrate the use of Rows and how they can stack up with each other. Some more projects playing around with Columns & Rows is likely a good idea. The core idea of playing around with the layout (Demonstrated here https://react-bootstrap.github.io/layout/grid/ ) needs to be explored further regarding dynamic layering of divs on top of each other.
